# Code-Uncommenter [DEPRECATED]
A small python script that removes all code comments. This was me learning python back in 2021, use at your own risk.

(Windows Standalone EXE version available here: https://github.com/Zylops/Code-Uncommenter/releases/tag/1.0 , The steps to use are the exact same.)

# How to use?
First, the program asks you for the file PATH, you can find this by clicking on the folder icon and copying it:

Then, the program asks you for the name of your file. Enter it.

If everything went alright, the program should say this:

An uncommented version of your code will appear in the same directory as your script with the name "filename-uncommented.fileext":

That's it! Happy uncommenting =)
