# Code-Uncommenter
A small python script that removes all comments from any type of text file (.py, .js, .everyothercodeformatonearth)!

# How to use?
First, the program asks you for the file PATH, you can find this by clicking on the folder icon and copying it:

Then, the program asks you for the name of your file. Enter it.

If everything went alright, the program should say this:

An uncommented version of your code will appear in the same directory as your script with the name "uncommented-version.txt":

That's it! Happy uncommenting =)
